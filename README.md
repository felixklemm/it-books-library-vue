# IT.Book.Library Vue

The customer is a library focused on IT books in the fictitious city of Foobar town. The library wants to make its books available online to give customers the possibility to save their favorite books in a list. It is your task to create this app for the customer.
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Run Api

```sh
npx bookmonkey-api
```

REST Api will be available on 127.0.0.1:4730

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
